Advent of Code 2021 Solutions in C++

Advent of code is here again and it's time to save Santa once more through your programming skills.  This year I am going to be programming in C++ which I have never coded from scratch.  These solutions will probably be pretty rough, so don't take any of this code as an example of the best way to do C++.  No guarantees that I'll get through all 25 days.  Last year I only made it to day 13.  The only thing I'll guarantee is that these solutions will work.

WARNING!!!  By definitaion these solutions are spoilers, so be sure to try solving them yourself.
